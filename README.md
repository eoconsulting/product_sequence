Product Sequence
================

This module allows to associate a sequence to the product reference.
The reference (default code) is unique (SQL constraint) and required.

Note: This module is incompatible with nan_product_sequence.

This software was original writed by **Zikzakmedia** for OpenERP 6.x, and
was patched by **Enterprise Objects Consulting** to be more compatible
with **OpenERP 6.1**, and fix some issues.
